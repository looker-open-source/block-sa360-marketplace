# What does this Looker Block do for me?

**This is not an officially supported Google product.**

- Quickly understand the state of your search ad campaigns across all engines with the SA360 Overview. Slice metrics like cost per acquisition and click through rate by variables like engine, advertiser, campaign and keyword.

- Go deep on the details of any campaign from the Campaign Performance Dashboard. Understand the trends over time for an individual campaignâ€™s performance based on the metrics that matter to you across all engines driving the campaign. Seamlessly switch between your Goal Metric and compare performance between customizable time periods.

- Understand the performance of individual keywords with the Keyword Performance Dashboard. Analyze your profitability overtime to optimize your spend strategy and increase revenue. With the ability to compare keyword performance between two periods of your choosing, you can determine how modifications in strategy have impacted keyword performance pre- and post-change. Whether you care about clicks, conversions, CPA or ROAS, Looker provides the ability to easily toggle between metrics so that you can analyze keyword performance curated around what matters most to your business.

- Compare Product performance with the Product Analytics Dashboard. Quickly understand which products are your highest earners to optimize your spend and increase ROI. Furthermore, understand how individual or groups of products are performing across a variety of KPIs; from clicks to click through rate, conversions to cost per acquisition.

- Enterprise Data Platform - Take advantage of Looker's data platform functionality, including data actions, scheduling, permissions, alerting, parameterization (each user can only see their own data), and more.

- Usable / Shareable Dashboards - create centralized dashboards for the entire team, and departmental or individual dashboards for each user, and rest easy knowing everyone is looking at the same information at all times. Then schedule the dashboard for emails or alerts, campaign-end reporting, or whatever else serves your use-case.

## Search Ads 360 Data Structure


- Prior to installing the block, you will need to use the BigQuery Data Transfer Service to load your data into BigQuery. The BigQuery Data Transfer Service for Search Ads 360 (formerly known as Doubleclick Search) allows you to automatically schedule and manage recurring load jobs for Search Ads 360 reporting data. More details can be found [here](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.google.com%2Fbigquery-transfer%2Fdocs%2Fsa360-transfer).

- This block was built off of BigQuery Views; virtual tables that expose aggregated data by day. When your Search Ads 360 (SA360) data is exported (in this case, through Transfer Services), the service also provides corresponding ingestion-time partitioned tables, denoted with the prefix *p_*. If you would rather have the block build off the partitioned tables, please change the ingested tables with the prefix *p_* in the LookML. The schema of the tables is nearly identical, but you will need to make addments to the two dimensions: changing *_data* to *_partitiontime* and *_latest* to *_current*, as seen in the code below.
-- *${TABLE}._DATA_DATE* -> *${TABLE}._PARTITIONTIME*
-- *${TABLE}._LATEST_DATE* -> *${TABLE}._CURRENT_DATE*

- Google's documentation on the data included in the export can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-transfer/docs/sa360-transformation).
- You can also find a cookbook of SQL queries for common questions in Google's documentation.
